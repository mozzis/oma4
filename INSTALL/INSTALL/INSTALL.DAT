 * FILE:
 *              INSTALL.DAT
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     This  script file will just present the Welcome screen; it requests
 *     the user replace the installation disk with the Program Disk 1 in
 *     the InDrive (Drive install uses).  It then chains to the file:
 *                      "Program.DAT"
 *     which must(?) have a label "Program Disk 1".
 *
 *     This  script file Program.DAT is specific to the particular
 *     application: Lock-In's, Magnemometer's, OMA's, etc...
 *
 *    The selections are made in the Program script file, but GSS drivers
 *    and GPIB.COM's are 'ZIPed' on the Install disk.  To add a driver,
 *    check the current revision of Install; if it has the driver, no
 *    problemo.  If it doesn't, the driver must be added to Install.
 *    An exception would be an application specific driver which could
 *    be kept on the Program disk.  Keeping GSS or GPIB drivers on the
 *    Program disk is discouraged, since this leads to various revisions
 *    of the drivers from the same revision of Install, and confusion.
 *
 *    The following are suggested Option values for the script file:
 *
 *   100 Video graphic types (101-1xx)
 *   200 Printers (201-2xx)
 *   300 Plotters (301-3xx)
 *   400 GPIB Cards (401-4xx)
 *   500 Pointing devices (501-5xx)
 *   600 Type of RAM disk software (601-603)
 *   600 Memory type for RAM disk (604-605)
 *   700 Output ports (701-7xx)
 *   900 Application program (901-9xx)

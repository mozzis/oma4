I saw something similar to your problem when repeated my testing of the 
DA program I sent you.  It looks like the program sometimes reads a track
before the ASIC finishes writing it. I made some changes which eliminated
the symptom, and which you may or may not be able to use.

Move ADD W #1, L1ADDR from line 28, just after ADD W #1, I1ADDR to line 30,
just after DO_IGNS.   Do the same thing where ADD W #1, L1ADDR occurs again,
about 16 lines later; move ADD W #1, L1ADDR to be just after DO_IGNS.  Re-
compile the DAC program with OMA4C and restart the OMA4000 program.

Now, in the Run Setup menu, select 1 as the number of ignored scans. The 
detector program will now ignore every other scan, but OMA4000 is forced 
to wait an additional frame time before reading the data.

I am continuing to investigate the timing which allows the program to read
prior to scan complete in the ON_TRIG to disk case.

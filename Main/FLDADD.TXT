How to add a field to a form:

Create a local data object to hold the field data.
Add the address of the data object to the data registry for the form.
If the field is a toggle, also create a string array and add it to
  the toggle registry for the form.
If the field is an action field, create a code routine to run when
  the field changes, and add it to the code registry for the form.
Add enums for the field and the label in the enum before the form.
Add the field (if possible, copy an existing field and modify)
Change the exit vectors for the new field and for fields which come
  before and after the new field.
Add the label field if any.
Add code to initialize the data object on form entry.
Add code to copy the data object externally when the form exits
  (unless the field has a verifier routine which runs when it
   changes)
Add an entry for the field to ksindex in the proper place.
Put the ksindex entry into the field.
Add an entry for the field to the FieldNames array in formlist.c
If necessary, change the form's entry in the FormBounds array in 
  formlist.c
Make sure that field functions correctly during keystroke record and 
  playback.
Add a macro function to get and set the field's value.
Refer to helpindx.h and oma40000.hlp to create a new help file entry
for the field, and put the index of that entry into the field definition.
If the new field affects method data, make sure that the method file
correctly saves and loads this data. If it affects detector data, make
sure that the detector driver gets updated with the field value. If it
affects plotting, make sure that the SetPlotStyle and GetPlotStyle 
macros support it.

Procedure SPEC_CMD(Command : String)
  Send arbitrary command string to spectrograph.  Must use 1235 command syntax, 
  not provided.

Procedure SPEC_GETS(Var Response : String)
  Get string response from spectrograph.  Must be preceded by SPEC_CMD with a 
  command which will produce some output.

Procedure SPEC_RESET()
  Reset the spectrograph to values in method header, obtain model number from
  spectrograph.  Every macro program which uses the spectrograph should use
  this command first.

Procedure SPEC_SELECT(Model : Integer)
  Select the spectrograph specified by Model.  Zero deselects any spectrograph.
  Same as Spectrograph field on menu.

Procedure SPEC_OFFSET()
  Assuming values have been entered into wavelength table, does same function as
  RESET OFFSET field of menu.

Procedure SPEC_GO()
  Sends Center wavelength to spectrograph.  Same as GO field on menu. 

Procedure SPEC_SET()
  Miscellaneous setup.  Should be used immediately after SPEC_RESET.

Procedure SPEC_WLEN(Wavelen : Real)
  Change center wavelen of spectrograph.  Should follow with SPEC_GO.

Procedure SPEC_GRATING(Grating : Integer)
  Select grating of spectrograph.
